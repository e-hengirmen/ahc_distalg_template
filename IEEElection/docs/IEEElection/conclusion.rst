Conclusion
==========

- The Leader Election protocol plays a critical role in IEEE 1394 networks by ensuring seamless communication and device coordination after a bus reset. This paper investigated the implementation of the IEEElection algorithm on the AHCv2 platform.
- The implementation exhibited linear scaling with the number of nodes which showed potential limitations of the simulation environment.
- A deeper analysis with a real network or a build in simulated time analysis added version of AHC platform could help us improve on this and other problems with same nature.
