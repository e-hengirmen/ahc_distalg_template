Abstract
========

This paper investigates the Leader Election Protocol within the IEEE 1394 standard by implementing and sharing our results,
Our aim is to understand its role in dynamic leadership assignment in networks with hot-pluggable devices and frequent bus resets.
The study presents the distributed algorithm for leader election that we refer as IEEElection.
Through practical examples and analysis, we highlight the protocol's effectiveness in facilitating seamless coordination and communication among interconnected devices using methods introduced in [Devillers]_.
Our findings underscore the importance of the Leader Election Protocol in optimizing the functionality and reliability of IEEE 1394 networks, offering valuable implications for the design and deployment of distributed systems.
